**Author's bibliographic coupling** - two authors are bibliographically coupled if they share at leas one reference form their reference lists.  Articles are nodes, shared references are edges.   

```{r  author coupling network, eval=TRUE}

Size is the number of vertices composing the network;

Density is the proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network;

Transitivity is the ratio of triangles to connected triples;

Diameter is the longest geodesic distance (length of the shortest path between two nodes) in the network;

Degree distribution is the cumulative distribution of vertex degrees;

Degree centralization is the normalized degree of the overall network;

Average path length is the mean of the shortest distance between each pair of vertices in the network.

netstat <- networkStat(NetMatrix)
